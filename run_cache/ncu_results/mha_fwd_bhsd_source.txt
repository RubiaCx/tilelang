  Note: The shown averages are calculated as the arithmetic mean of the metric values after the evaluation of the    
  metrics for each individual kernel launch.                                                                         
  If aggregating across varying launch configurations (like shared memory, cache config settings), the arithmetic    
  mean can be misleading and looking at the individual results is recommended instead.                               
  This output mode is backwards compatible to the per-kernel summary output of nvprof
